Installation instructions
=========================
We recommend installing `anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/>`_ prior to using this package.

Installing *nussl* is easy using pip and the Python Package Index. This will install all required dependencies alongside the
*nussl* installation. Use the following command::

        pip install nussl

or::

        sudo pip install nussl

to install system-wide. **It is highly recommended to install** *nussl* **inside a**
`venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ **because it is under active development.**

Alternatively, you may download the source code and install with the following command::

        python setup.py nussl

Finally, you may download and copy the nussl folder into your working directory and directly import the modules

*nussl* requires:
* ``python 2.7``
* ``numpy version >= 1.8.0``
* ``scipy version >= 0.13.0``
* ``matplotlib version >= 1.3.1``
* ``audioread >= 2.1.2``
* ``librosa >= 0.4.1``

The first four are satisfied by `anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/>`_.
