Mask Classes
============

Classes pertaining to using masks (for applying onto time-frequency representations) in nussl. Many algorithm classes
in nussl return a set of ``MaskBase``-derived objects. See :ref:`mask_separation_base` for more info.

The list of Mask related classes in nussl is below:
